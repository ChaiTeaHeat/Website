			<h2>Our Motto</h2>
			<p>A chain is only as strong as its weakest link</p>
			<div>
				<p>
				We apply this to ourselves. We apply this to our relationships. We apply this to the world.
				A community thrives when its individuals work together to better themselves and eachother.
				Our belief is that the individual also thrives when they serve and better their community.
				It takes a certain kind of desire to motivate oneself to spend their time doing so.		
				Chai Tea is an organization seeking those individuals with such a motivational desire.	
				We understand that when these individuals work together, great changes can be made.		
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<p>To bring together those people who seek positive change</p>
			<div>
				<p>
				The problems we face as both individuals and a society are complex and vague. 				
				Experts claim they have the solutions to these problems, but these solutions do not suffice.
				The key to solving these problems is understanding the problem in the first place.			
				Understanding such a problem requires open discussion and willingness to act.				
				This means bringing together all kinds of open-minded people with diverse backgrounds. 		
				This means understanding one another as individuals, to understand each's role in society. 	
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Our Mantra</h2>
			<p>Abala ekaka, balavantu ekato</p>
			<div>
				<p>
					That is the Chai Tea mantra.													
					It is our belief that real change starts with the individual.					
					People follow by example, and thus we must lead by example.						
					Instead of telling others to make a difference, we take the first step.			
					If you want to engage with your community and help others, Chai Tea is for you.		
				</p>
